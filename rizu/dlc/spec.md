# DLC System (`rizu.dlc`)

## Goal
The DLC system enables players to expand their music library directly from within the game. It provides a modular framework for discovering, downloading, and installing content from external platforms like osu! and Etterna without requiring manual file management.

## User Experience
Players access the **DLC Screen** from the sidebar to browse and search for new content.
- **Discovery**: A unified search interface allows players to select a specific platform (provider) and search for content within it.
- **Filtering**: Results can be narrowed down using platform-specific criteria, such as key counts for Etterna or difficulty ratings for osu!.
- **Previewing**: For supported content types (currently only osu! beatmapsets), players can see thumbnails and listen to 10-second audio previews to evaluate a chart before downloading.
- **Background Downloads**: Clicking "Download" triggers a background process. Players can continue browsing or playing other songs while a progress bar shows real-time speed and completion status.
- **Auto-Installation**: Once a download completes, the content is automatically extracted and indexed. The library is refreshed, and the new charts appear immediately in the song selection screen.

## Architecture Decisions (ADR)

### ADR: Background Worker (`ThreadRemote`)
- **Context**: Downloading and unzipping large archives (especially Etterna packs which can exceed 300MB) causes significant frame drops and UI freezes in the main Lua thread.
- **Decision**: We use `ThreadRemote` to delegate all network and I/O heavy operations to a dedicated `DlcWorker`.
- **Consequence**: The UI remains responsive. Communication between the UI and the worker is handled via asynchronous message passing.

### ADR: Third-Party Mirrors for osu!
- **Context**: The official osu! beatmap API requires OAuth authentication for downloads, which would require players to log in to download charts.
- **Decision**: We route osu! downloads through public mirrors (e.g., BeatConnect, Mino).
- **Consequence**: Players can download content without authentication, though we are dependent on the availability and uptime of these third-party services.

## Implementation Details

### Download Types
The system handles three primary content types, which determine the extraction destination:
- **`pack`**: Large archives containing multiple song folders (e.g., Etterna packs). Extracted to `userdata/charts/packs/`.
- **`set`**: Archives for a single song grouping (e.g., osu! beatmapsets). Extracted to `userdata/charts/downloads/`.
- **`file`**: Individual chart files. Downloaded to a specific destination folder or `userdata/charts/downloads/`.

### Archive Extraction
The `DlcExtractor` utility handles `.zip` and `.osz` formats.
- **Flattening**: Many archives (like Etterna packs) wrap their contents in a redundant top-level folder. The extractor automatically flattens these structures during extraction to ensure the `dir` field in the library remains clean (e.g., `PackName/Song/` becomes `Song/`).
