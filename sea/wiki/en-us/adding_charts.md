# Adding charts/music
There are 4 ways to add charts to soundsphere. We recommend to familiarize yourself with all of them.

soundsphere supports the following chart formats:
- `.osu` - beatmaps from **osu!**
- `.qua` - charts from **Quaver**.
- `.sm` and `.ssc` - charts from **StepMania** and **Etterna**.
- `.bms`, `.bme`, `.bml` and `.pms` - charts from **Lunatic Rave 2**, **beatoraja** and other **Beatmania** simulators
- `.ojn` - charts from **o2jam**
- `.ksh` - charts from **K-Shoot MANIA**
- `.sph` - charts from **soundsphere**
- `.mid` and `.midi`.

At the very end of the page you can find links to the chart download pages.

## Adding a chart library from a folder
Using this method you will be able to specify the path to a folder with charts on disk. This is the best way to add all the charts from other rhythm games installed on your computer. The game will read from the location you specified without copying files.

First you need to find the folder with the charts, it can be the `Songs` folder from **osu!**, **Quaver** or **Etterna**, or just a folder with the charts in it. We are interested in folders with this file hierarchy (**osu!** and **Quaver**):
```
songs_folder/
├── song1/
│ ├── audio.mp3
│ ├── easy.osu
│ └── hard.osu
├── song2/
├── song3/
```

soundsphere also supports searching for charts from subfolders (**Etterna** and **StepMania**):
```
songs_folder/
├── pack1/
│ ├── song1/
│ │ ├── audio.mp3
│ │ └── chart.sm
│ ├── song2/
│ └── song3/
├── pack2/
├── pack3/
```

This method of adding charts requires a root folder, in the examples above it is `songs_folder`, in the case of **osu!**, **Quaver** and **Etterna** it will be the `Songs` folder.

1. Start soundsphere.
2. On the bottom left of the screen, click the folder icon.
3. You need to create a different location for each folder. Click on the `create location` button
4. On the right side of the menu you will be able to rename the location. Give it a suitable name.
5. Next, drag the folder with charts into the game window. This way the game will get the path to this folder.
6. Click `update` and wait for the charts to be added.

> After adding charts, you will need to click on the `collections` button in the bottom right corner of the screen and in the same place click on the `notecharts` button to update the list of charts. This will be fixed in the new version of the UI. This also applies to the following method.

## Adding new charts to the soundsphere folder
soundsphere has its own charts folder where you can put charts of any format. This folder is located at the path: `userdata/charts/` relative to the root of the game. You should add new charts in subfolders.

1. Go to `userdata/charts/`.
2. Create a folder in which you will put the charts. For example, the path would be as follows: `userdata/charts/cool_songs/`.
3. In this folder put charts or packs (subfolders with charts).
4. Go into the game and click on the folder icon in the bottom left corner of the screen. 
5. Make sure the `soundsphere` location is selected. Click on the `update` button on the right side menu.

## Adding `.osz` charts 
1. Drag `.osz` into the game window.
2. That's it.
